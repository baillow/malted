<p><font size="4"><b><a name="Open">Open</a> a courseware</b>
</font></p>
<p>Normally, on opening the Run Time System a courseware 
selection frame will be displayed, as shown in the
screen captures below.<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<div align="center">
	<table id="table1" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="80%">
		<tbody><tr>
			<td>
			<img border="0" src="../images/index_b.jpg" width="310" height="232"></td>
			<td>
			<p align="right">
			<img src="../images/access_b.jpg" border="0" height="232" width="310"></p></td>
		</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>If in the Index frame, click on one of the repository section buttons, then 
select one of the units (courseware), and finally click on the
View Unit button for the opening frame of the course to be displayed. When you exit a 
course, the Index frame will still be
there, ready for a new selection.</p>
<p>If in the multi-point selection frame, first select one of 
the modes: Local hard disk, LAN or Online. With the first two
options, a user dialog
interface will open as a pop-up window. By selecting the projects source in the 
upper section,
the available projects will appear in the lower section in alphabetical order. You can then browse within the existing
assets and finally select a courseware to be displayed. The Online option will 
connect you to the Malted remote official
resources base.</p>
<p>At any time, you may click on the Open icon&nbsp;<img src="../images/open.gif" nosave="" height="18" width="18">
on the <a href="../Navbar/NavBar.htm">navigation bar</a> and the asset selection 
pop-up window will
be shown again. Hence, you do not need to exit the application to view a new 
courseware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4"><b><a name="Connect">Connect</a> to
the Asset Base</b> </font></p><p>In the case the assets are to be downloaded through the
network, an animated symbol shows that the downloading is
in process. Once
the connection with the remote AssetBase has been established, the assets
are downloaded in the
cache of the computer with all their associated assets
(e.g. a courseware script with all its associated images and
audio files).
When this process is over, you will be able to run the course.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>

<br>Click on the exit icon&nbsp;<img src="../images/exit.gif" nosave="" height="18" width="18">
