          exactly in the same way as the old <strong>winRecord</strong> ACTION was used i.e. one
          puts as VALUE the name of the wav file in which the recording will be saved. The

          recording starts when the user clicks the button and continues until the button is clicked
          a second time. While the recording is being done the button changes colours and has label <strong>stop</strong>.

          in the previous case, however it is not saved in a file. In order <strong>to play</strong>

        <li>An error was fixed on the size and location of Malted frames in popOutFrames. The <strong>size</strong>
          specified in a popOutFrame call was being adopted as the size of the whole window frame
          but the &quot;centering&quot; was being calculated as if it was the internal size. &nbsp;
          Now the specified size becomes the <strong>internal size</strong> without the title and
          borders. Thus an author must specify the internal size from now on. This is particularly
          important when using <font face="Courier New">FITSCREEN=false</font>.</li>
        <li>Another modification is that in all previous versions, when <font face="Courier New">FITSCREEN</font>
          was <font face="Courier New">false</font> and the size of the window was smaller that the
          size of the Malted frame, then the later did not appeared centerd but with its left upper
          corner coinciding with the left upper corner of the interior of the window. Now it always
          appears centered. This modifies the behaviour but in general the result is better,
          particularly when the user modifies the size of the window.&nbsp; </li>

      <td width="100%"><strong>Print</strong>.<ul>
        <li>A new printing system has been developed because the older one proved to be very
          unstable with respect to variations in JRE versions. The older system worked well in JRE
          1.1, prints only in gray tones in JRE 1.3.1_01 and 1.4 and fails completely in JRE
          1.3.1_02. </li>
        <li>There printing user interface is the same as before. The user can call the printing
          function to print the contents of the screen from the main menu. Also when right click is
          done over a media object, the print option appears and if the user selects it the contents
          of the media object are printed. If the media object has a text area the whole contents of
          the text are printed, otherwise the visual aspect is printed.</li>
        <li>The size of the printed image is calculated to fit the Malted runtime screen in the
          printing area, maintaining the width to height proportions. Thus a 800x600 Malted screen
          will appear bigger if printed in landscape orientation than in portrait orientation. When
          printing only a media object the printed image is located at top left of the printing area
          and the size is proportional to the area it occupies on the screen. In other words the
          media objects in a Malted frame are printed with the same size as they would appear in a
          printing of the whole frame. One exception is the printing of text areas which will print
          the whole text. This normally results in a longer (in the vertical sense) printed image
          than what the visible part would occupy.</li>
        <li>The print function called from the &quot;right click menu&quot; in a popOutText prints
          the whole text fitting it to&nbsp; the width of the printing area.</li>
        <li><strong><em>Note</em></strong>: The printing results may differ from the ones obtained
          with JRE 1.1.</li>
        <li><strong><em>Note</em></strong>: Some properties of the printer (in particular
          orientation) must be defined before calling the printer dialog from the Malted runtime,
          otherwise they are ignored. This is not a bug of Malted or Java. It seems to be a general
          bug in windows printing since the same phenomenon has been detected in programs written
          for example in Delphi.</li>

          it occupied the with of the frame, started at the bottom of the panel and ended at the
          bottom of the frame. Only the parts of the slider that were not being covered by a media
          object were shown. The result was quite ugly. The slider has been removed in this version

      <td width="100%"><strong>Memory handling</strong>.<ul>
        <li>Recent versions have produced some out of memory errors. They were due to a diminished
          frequency of calls to the garbage collector. This has been essentially corrected by
          calling the garbage collector in some places where the calls had been suppresed to insure
          quick response to user interaction. A compromise has been adopted which seems reasonable
          between quick reaction and efficient garbage collection. </li>
        <li>All previous versions maintained in RAM the image resorces of all the cards of all the
          panels in a frame. In beta 8 this is no longer true, only the images of the active cards
          are kept in RAM. This puts a much smaller toll on RAM, particularly in frames with many
          cards in a panel like those used in Dialog interactions. This is done with little impact
          on speed when changing cards. </li>
        <li>For these reasons the probability of an out of memory error in this beta 8 version is
          noticeably less than in beta 7 and also less than in all previous versions. However it is
          important to make the authors of Malted courses aware of what things consume excesive
          memory and may favour these undesirable out of memory errors. </li>
      </ul>
      <p align="center"><strong>Things that put a lage toll on RAM requirements</strong>.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Large images. By large it is meant images that have a large area, even if they come in
          small files. Try to use small images. If only a part of the image is being shown, it is
          recommended to cut it so that it does not ocupy excesive memory.</li>
        <li>Recording modes 2 and 4 keep the recordings in RAM. If the exercise has many cards with
          a recording in each one and these recordings are being kept in RAM then this may cause an
          out of memory error. It is recomended that when the recording exercise has many cards, the
          recording should be done to files to avoid this problem. In general we do not recommend
          recording modes 2 and 4 except for isolated recording exercises.</li>
        <li>popOutFrames use memory on top of what is being used by the frame from which they pop
          out. Thus the use of frames poping out of other pop out frames is not recommended.</li>

          shown embedded side by side to a text area containing its transcription. The student may
          start and stop the video or audio and at the same time browse the transcription using the

          <strong>yes</strong> and <strong>no</strong>. It has meaning only when <strong>gapSize=0</strong>,
          which means that the size of the gap must be adjusted to the contents of the gap. In this
          case, the value <strong>yes</strong> makes the size of the gap be equal to the length of
          the content of the gap plus 4 pixels. The value <strong>no</strong> makes the adjustement
          by counting the number of letters, multiplying it by the length of the character 'm',
          which is normally the longest one in a font, and adding 4. If gapBORDER=yes then 4 more
          pixels are added to take into account the border of the text field. <br>
          <strong>Note</strong>: If a gap has more than one possible solution, then in both cases
          the adjustment is done using the first solution. The default value is <strong>no</strong>.</font></li>

          of the JRE for the case when the browser doesn't understand Java. It detecs the user
          language and gives all messages in Spanish if it is the user language, otherwise the
          messages are given in English. It also detects if the JRE installed is addequate for
          Malted and if it isn't it offers a link to install the correct JRE. The applet is now a
          &quot;signed applet&quot; and thus is asks the user for permission. Once the applet has
          received permission to operate, it verifies if the JMF is installed and if it is not it
          offers a link to perform the installation.<br>
          The prototype for calling the applet can be found in the applet calls at:</li>

        <li>The signed applet has essentially the same functionality as the RTS with the exception
          of the following details:<ol>
            <li>When the edit course and edit frame buttons are present in remote mode the applet gives

        <li>The applet writes it's date and time in the Java Console. This is so to provide
          information to the user on which varsion is being used to report possible problems.</li>
        <li>The applet allows editing of frames and courses when it is working in local mode.</li>
        <li>There is no need to edit the <strong>security.policy</strong> for the applet to work.</li>

        <li>In Windows it is possible to associate the course extension<font face="Courier"> <strong>.cxml</strong></font>

          media object writing MEDIA.medianame.TEXT. where &quot;medianame&quot; is to be
          substituted by the NAME of the media object. The VALUE of the ACTION should be written in

          this can be seen in the <strong>freeWriting</strong> template. There <font face="Courier">medianame=message</font>.<br>
          All this work OK both in Eudora and Outlook. However in Eudora one can also add
          ?subject=whatever... but Outlook only interprets one of these parameters so one must
          choose either to include the subject or the body but not both. In Outlook if one uses both
          parameters everything is included in the parameter that comes first.</font></p>

        <li>A new cashing system has been developed for remote execution both by the applet and the
          RTS. The system creates a &quot;Malted_cache&quot; subdirectory of the user.dir. Almost
          every remote file is downloaded and copied into this subdirectory. All use af these files
          is done directly from the cache. When files are more than 2 hours old, the system checks
          if the original file has changed and if so the new version is downloaded, otherwise the
          time and date of the file is modified and it is not verified for another two hours. mp3
          files bigger than 50Kb and mpeg files bigger than 1MB are not downloaded, instead they are
          reproduced by streaming.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>In the <strong>Gapfilling</strong> interaction it is now possible to navigate from one
          gap to the next one by using the tab keys. In previous versions this was not always
          possible.</li>
        <li>In <strong>GapFilling</strong> there has two new parameters: <strong><font
          face="Courier">gapPad</font></strong> and <strong><font face="Courier">autoJump</font></strong>.
          <font face="Courier">gapPad</font> defines the extra number of spaces to be added to a gap
          above the gapSize. The default value is 1.<font face="Courier"> autoJump</font> is a
          boolean value with default value <font face="Courier"><strong>no</strong></font>. If the
          value is <strong><font face="Courier">yes</font></strong> then when the caret (or text
          cursor) reaches the size of the gap, it jumps to the next gap.</li>
        <li>The <strong>Order</strong> interaction has been modified. Before this version when a
          phrase or word was dragged and dropped into the site of another one then the sencond one
          jumped to occupy the position of the first one, i.e. the ordering was done by <em>swaping</em>
          words or phrases. In this version the ordering is done by <em>insertion</em>, i.e. &nbsp;
          the words or phrases are shifted to accomodate the one that was moved, maintaining their
          relative order.</li>
        <li>In <strong>MultipleChoice</strong>, when it uses check boxes, then a click on the button
          changes the checkbox status just as if the checkbox itself was clicked.</li>
        <li>The <strong>Match2</strong> interaction has three new parameters: <font face="Courier">markUsed</font>,
          <font face="Courier">markedFGCOLOR</font> and <font face="Courier">markedBGCOLOR</font>.
          The later only have meaning when <font face="Courier">markUsed=yes</font>. In this case
          the options that have been used once change their color and background color according to
          the <font face="Courier">markedFGCOLOR</font> and <font face="Courier">markedBGCOLOR</font>
          defined. This new feature is exemplified in the Match_000.template (Drag and Drop).</li>
        <li>The <strong>setLang</strong> action has been improved. Now, when called in the middle of
          an interaction,&nbsp; it changes all media contents for those media that do not intervene
          in the interaction. Upon reload all media contents are translated. Thus if a course is
          designed in such a way that the various languages are only used in informative media
          objectes, then the translation works immediately at any time respecting the work of the
          student.</li>
        <li>If the <strong>setLang</strong> action is called on a <strong>popOut</strong> frame or
          course, when this is closed, the new language is used immediately on the active frame just
          as if the setLang action was called from it. Thus it is possible to make a language change
          precisely by using a popOut for this purpose.</li>
        <li>The actions <strong>verify</strong> and <strong>check</strong> have been uniformized as
          much as possible and a new&nbsp; &quot;verification&quot; action <strong>solve</strong>
          has been developed. <br>
          The <strong>verify</strong> action marks the correct answers of the student in the
          &quot;correct&quot; color and the incorrect answers in &quot;wrong&quot; color, but it
          does not provide the correct answers. <br>
          The <strong>check</strong> action erases the incorrect answers and marks the correct ones.
          <br>
          The <strong>solve</strong> action puts the correct results everywhere, turning marking in
          &quot;correct&quot; color the ones that were correctly written by the student and into
          &quot;wrong&quot; color those who weren't.<br>
          <strong>verify</strong> and <strong>check</strong> work in GapFilling, Crossword2,
          Crossword and MultipleChoice.&nbsp; The <strong>solve</strong> action works only in
          GapFilling and Crossword2.</li>

      variable</strong>. The values of the variables are set using one of the two new media
      actions: <strong>setFrameVariable</strong> and <strong>setCourseVariable</strong>. The
      course variables are kept during the whole course while the frame variables are kept only
      the life time of the frame. For example, you can use in a media the action <strong>setCourseVariable(sex=Female)</strong>
      and the value of this variable can be used in any course link with <em>Condition</em> set
      to <strong>courseVariable</strong> and <em>Value</em> set to <strong>sex=Female</strong>

      example, in a media you can set <em>Action</em> to <strong>setFrameVariable</strong> and <em>Value</em>
      to <strong>clicks+1</strong> (which means incrementing by one the value of variable <strong>clicks</strong>).
      <em>Numerical</em> variables are initialized to zero and <em>string</em> variables are

      card). The AutoAction of a card is executed each time the card is shown. If a Frame has

      simultaneously with the AutoAction of the Frame when it is loaded. </font></li>
    <li><p align="left"><font color="#000000"><strong>IgnoreCase </strong>is a new parameter of

      considered as equal.</font></p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><font color="#000000"><strong>Contractions</strong>. The GapFilling
      interaction has a new parameter named <strong>equivStrings</strong>. To use it he author
      must assign a file name to it, for example <strong>text/contractForms.txt</strong> . The
      file should contain one string in each line. Two consecutive strings are considered
      equivalent by the gap filling exercise. The&nbsp; <strong>text/contractForms.txt</strong>
      file provided in Templates contains all contract forms in English written in lower case
      and also starting with a capital. Thus they will work well both with <strong>ignoreCase</strong>
      set to <strong>yes</strong> and with&nbsp; <strong>ignoreCase</strong> set to <strong>no.</strong>
      &nbsp; This file is used in the new Gap Filling Template named <strong>TextGapsWithContractions.template</strong>.</font></p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><font color="#000000"><strong>Order</strong>. A new interaction was
      developed. The student can order media objects (with text labels, images, audio or video)
      by draging one and dropping it in place of another. The object that was where the drop is
      made goes back to where the dragged object came from.<strong> </strong></font></p>

    <li><p align="left"><font color="#000000"><strong>Print. </strong>When the user makes a
      right click on a text area or any media object, a small popup menu appears offering the
      user the options <strong>print</strong> / <strong>dictionary. </strong>On a popup text the
      popup menu that appears with the right clickoffers only the option <strong>print</strong>.
      If the user selects print&nbsp; contents of the media object or text area are sent to the
      printer. If the printer is correctly configured in Windows this prompts the Windows
      printer dialog to appear.</font></p>

      must do all the exercises&quot; and similar messages telling the user that he/she cannot
      verify without completing the exercise were not uniform. Now they are the same in all
      interactions and the program shows a different one when there is only one card and when
      there are several cards.</font></p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><font color="#000000"><strong>Recording</strong> is now done always in
      the cache subdirectory of the MALTED_HOME directory. This is done automatically, the
      author has nothing to do for this to happen (except provide dummy audio files in the
      project directory to cheat the DVE and the RTS). When an audio is to be played by the RTS,
      it first looks for it in the cache. Only if it doesn't find the file in the cache it goes
      to the project directory to look for it. For this reson it is important to have dummy
      audio files for recordings in the project. This dummy files will not be overwritten with
      the recordings and are reproduced only if no user has made the recording exercise. In the
      future the cache directory may separate the recordings of different users so they can be
      used by the tutors to evaluate the pronunciation of their students.</font></p>

    <li><p align="left"><font color="#000000">The <strong>Hangman</strong> and <strong>Crossword</strong>

      <strong>check</strong> and <strong>verify</strong> with values <strong>anyTime</strong>
      and <strong>atEnd</strong>. When the value is <strong>atEnd</strong> the buttons don't
      work, if clicked without finishing the exercise a dialgo window appears telling the user
      that he/she must finish the exercise before checking or verifying.</font></p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><font color="#000000"><strong>Crossword2</strong>. There is a new
      interaction for crosswords.&nbsp; The interaction allows moving with the keyboard arrows
      and the answers must be typed in their place. The sqares contain the numbers of the
      definitions as it is done in English language crossword puzzles. There are two media
      objects in the template. The first one contains the crossword grid with which the user
      interacts. The second one shows the &quot;across&quot; and &quot;down&quot; definitions
      corresponding to the location of the cursor at any time. This interaction has <strong>check</strong>
      and <strong>verify</strong> buttons.&nbsp; The <strong>check</strong> button erases the
      incorrect letters and turns to blue the </font><strong><font color="#0000FF">correct</font></strong><font
      color="#000000"> ones. The <strong>verify</strong> button gives the correct answer putting
      in red the </font><strong><font color="#FF0000">errors</font></strong><font
      color="#000000"> and in blue the </font><font color="#0000FF"><strong>correct</strong></font><font
      color="#000000"> letters. As the in the other crossword interaction, there are two
      parameters <strong>check</strong> and <strong>verify</strong> with values <strong>anyTime</strong>
      and <strong>atEnd</strong>. When the value is <strong>atEnd</strong> the buttons don't
      work, if clicked without finishing the exercise a dialgo window appears telling the user
      that he/she must finish the exercise before checking or verifying. This new interaction is
      illustrated as a new template. In order to create one exercise the author must write all
      information in a text file. Here is the example text file provided in templates:</font></p>

    <li><p align="left"><font color="#000000"><strong>Crossword2</strong> (continued). As can be
      seen above, the author of a crossword text file must first write the size of the grid, 9x9
      in the example. Then the grid ordered exactly as it should appear. Each element of the
      grid is represented with a blank space or a number in brackets followed by the letter of
      that element. Black or empty elements are represented by [ ]*. After the grid the file
      should contain word <strong>Across</strong> in one line followed by all &quot;across&quot;
      definitions each one in a single line. Finally the word <strong>Down</strong> in one line
      followed by all the &quot;down&quot; definitions, each one in a single line. The
      definitions must be preceeded by the number that identifies it's position in the grid and
      a dot. The first media object of the template has <strong>name=&quot;Crossword&quot;</strong>
      and must have as <strong>TEXT</strong> the name of the name of the file containing the
      crossword. In the example it is<small><font face="Courier New"><strong> txt/TheWeather.txt</strong></font></small>.
      The second media object has <strong>name=&quot;Definitions&quot;</strong> and in TEXT the
      words&nbsp; &quot;Across|Down&quot; or the ones that the author wants to appear before the
      across and down definitions.</font></p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><p align="left"><font color="#000000"><strong>onAssociation. Match 2</strong> has a new
      possible value for the parameter: <strong>verify. </strong>When this new value is assigned
      to the verify parameter,&nbsp; the match instead of drag and drop turns to dragging a <strong>moving
      line</strong> (like an <strong>elastic band</strong>) from the origin to the mouse cursor.
      When the mouse button is released over the destination then, if the association is correct
      a &quot;correct&quot; sound is produced and the line remians fixed. If the association is
      incorrect the line disappears. This interaction can be applied to vocabulary exercises
      askin the student to associate words in one language to their translation in a second
      language or from images to words or viceversa.</font></p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><font color="#000000">The <strong>language translation</strong> has been
      improved in the memory interaction. In the previous version when the user tried to change
      the language on a memory interaction that had already been started the result was very
      bad. This is due to the fact that the interactions fool around with the contents of media
      objects. The problem has been solved in the memory interaction but it is not possible to
      solve it in general. We suggest that no translations of exercise contents are provided by
      the author. Whatever is modified by the interaction should not be translated. Thus only
      explanations, fixed button labels and stimmuli should be translated.</font></p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><font color="#000000">In the previous version the <strong>mouse events</strong>
      did not work well with all interactions. This has been solved. </font></p>
    </li>
    <li><p align="left"><font color="#000000"><strong>Errors in Frames</strong>. When a frame
      can't be loaded because it contains an error both the DVE and the RTS log files now will
      give the name of the faulty frame. Frames can contain errors because the file becomes
      corrupted or because of a human error produced when it is edited manually. Previous
      versions would break down but did not give the name of the faulty frame. This is
      particularly important in the DVE because it tries to read all the frames in a project
      when the project is opened and if only one frame has an error, the program crashes. If
      this happens you can now consult the dve.log file to see if there is a faulty frame.</font></p>

    <li><font size="3"><strong>RTSFullScreen</strong>. An important change has been made in the
      implementation of the RTSFullScreen. It used to be implemented as a Java Window, while all
      the other Malted programs were implemented as Java Frames. This caused some odd behaviour,
      particularly in Gap filling exercises. Sometimes the text cursor did not appear. At other
      times the text would be written on a different gap from where the cursor was, etc. This
      was due to a bug in Swing Windows. Now the RTS is implemented as a Java Frame and thus the
      behaviour of the cursor is exactly the same as in the normal RTS. Other possible
      differences should now be eliminated.</font></li>

    <li><strong>Tooltips</strong>: Media objects can have tooltips i.e. text that appears when
      the mouse remains still a couple of seconds over the object.</li>
    <li><strong>HTML</strong>: Media objects may have a simple html file as their TEXT
      attribute. This text is an example. Also simple html text can be used both in labels and

    <li><strong>Translations</strong>: A new system of translation has been developed. The user
