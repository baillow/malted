        </u> It features a lack of interaction. It is used in exercises that do 
        not require any of the other interactions, either because they are simply 
        screens to be seen with no other purpose, or because the media actions 
        and properties are enough so as to produce interaction with the user, 
        such as writing exercises, listening exercises, video ones or <strong>any 
        other type of exercise that does not require a verify button</strong>.</font></p>
